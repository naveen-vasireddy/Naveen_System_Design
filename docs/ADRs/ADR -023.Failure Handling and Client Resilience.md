# ADR-023: Failure Handling and Client Resilience

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** Day 40

## Context
In our distributed cache, nodes will fail. We need to decide how clients handle these failures to avoid cascading outages.

## Decision
1.  **Fail-over Strategy:** If the primary node for a key is unreachable (timeout/error), the client will immediately try the **next node in the replication ring**.
2.  **Timeouts:** All TCP connections will have a strict **200ms timeout**.
3.  **Node Removal:** The `HealthMonitor` (server-side or smart-client side) will remove nodes after 3 consecutive failures to prevent routing traffic to a black hole.

## Consequences
*   **Pros:** System remains available even if 1/3 nodes are down.
*   **Cons:** During the detection window (before removal), some requests will experience latency (timeout + retry).
